üí° RECOMMENDATIONS
------------------
Based on the comprehensive evaluation:

1. DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY
   ‚Ä¢ Use Random Forest for maximum accuracy
   ‚Ä¢ Use Enhanced Fuzzy K-NN for interpretability
   ‚Ä¢ Implement ensemble approach for critical decisions

2. FAIRNESS CONSIDERATIONS
   ‚Ä¢ Monitor bias metrics across demographic groups
   ‚Ä¢ Implement regular fairness audits
   ‚Ä¢ Consider bias mitigation techniques if needed

3. OPERATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION
   ‚Ä¢ Establish confidence thresholds for different use cases
   ‚Ä¢ Implement human-in-the-loop for borderline cases
   ‚Ä¢ Regular model retraining with new data

‚ö†Ô∏è LIMITATIONS
---------------
‚Ä¢ Limited temporal data for comprehensive time-series validation
‚Ä¢ Organizational data based on simulation rather than actual records
‚Ä¢ Sample size constraints for some demographic subgroups
‚Ä¢ Evaluation based on synthetic organizational involvement patterns

üöÄ FUTURE WORK
---------------
‚Ä¢ Validate with real organizational involvement data
‚Ä¢ Extend evaluation to multiple universities
‚Ä¢ Implement longitudinal tracking of prediction accuracy
‚Ä¢ Develop adaptive threshold optimization
‚Ä¢ Investigate causal relationships in feature importance
